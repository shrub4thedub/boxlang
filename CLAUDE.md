Box

Box is a scripting DSL for creating CLI's and safe build/install scripts; it can be used for other things but those are the main purposes.

It is written in Go - the full spec is available at SPEC.md.

You can use ./box lex and ./box ast to check how things are being lexed and parsed when debugging.
